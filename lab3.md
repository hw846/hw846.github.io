# Lab 2 Overview:
In this lab, I explore how to set up the IMU on the Artemis and transmit data from its gyroscope/accelerometer to my PC (and record a cool stunt on my new robot). All work was done on a 2020 M1 Macbook. 
```Final Wordcount: 998```

## Setting up the IMU

#### Pre-Lab
For this pre-lab, the only requirement was to read on the [Sparkfun IMU](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-9dof-imu-breakout-icm-20948-qwiic.html). I read through this and was prepared.
