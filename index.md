## Introduction

I am a PhD student obtaining a PhD in Robotics with a focus in Mechanical Engineering & Computer Science in the Organic Robotics Lab under the direction of Rob Shepherd. I am also a recent graduate of Rice University where I obtained a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (Minor in Engineering Design). I am broadly interested in bio-mimetic robotics, integrable technology, and mechatronic devices that can be utilized to interact with the world around us, and I explore these various topics in my research.

At Rice, I served as a Robotics Research Assistant in the RobotPi Lab under the direction of Dr. Kaiyu Hang, publishing one first-author paper and acquiring a supplementary patent. Additionally, I have worked for both the Rice University Mechanical Engineering Department and Rice University Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen as a Teaching Assistant to further promote and teach Engineering in the Rice undergraduate & graduate community.
